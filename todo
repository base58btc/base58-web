	- questions for taproot class
		These questions help us figure out how prepared you are for this class, as well as helping us get a good understanding of general dev knowledge around bitcoin primitives. Demonstrated ability to understand technical topics is a requirement for this class, as taproot is quite technical.

- to build:
	x integrate tailwind (make pretty!)
	- style pages
	  x index
	  x course
		- markdown formatted info for longer desc
		- optional video embed?
	  x register
	  x checkout
	  x success
	  - waitlist
	- checkout with bitcoin
		- integrate opennode's checkout, for launch!

	- emails
		- use the emailer
		- signup confirmation email
		- write emails in notion, as pages?

	- don't show sessions w/in 12h of start (or after first) date
	- turn on waitlist for oversold classes
	- disable submit button on stripe form
	x waitlist page
		- idempotency check?
	x checkout page (single item atm!)
		- idempotency check


- to think about:
	- blog
	- v2: nostr pubkeys
		- send nostr notice
	- v2: specific pages for confs?
	- v2: popup for newsletter signup?
	- v2: cart
	- v2: cookies? https://www.calhoun.io/securing-cookies-in-go/
	- v2: session marker (store cart state in browser cookies)
	- v2: custom btc backend; watching the mempool, waiting for a pay-to address
		- when do we degrade/stop watching for an address? (btcpay's timeout)
		- is there a lightweight way to continually scan for a bunch of addresses?
			- yes, if we get blocks to scan on a background process?
			- what to do if payment < or > requested amt?

		- after 60m, we fall back to the on-block check

	- next address (from descriptor) 
		- new address for every *session* update
	- v2: bolt12
	x BIP21 + BOLT11 payment options 
		x bip21 // LN invoice
		- click to copy  
	- notification from LN node that has been paid? (websocket to server?)
		- stripe calls back to server
		- CLN notifies server
		- polling for mempool.space
		- pipe response to checkout (if still around)
		- mark as paid in notion
		- email purchase receipt
	- recurring subscriptions for access to all replit content?
	- ship w/ nix

- bitcoin acceptance pipeline!
	- make a service that does a callback when an address is 
		- confirmed  (includes transaction)
		- in mempool (includes transaction)
		- reaches depth X (includes transaction)
	- service ... sends an event?
